Common repository for H-He equations of state and miscibility curves. The H-He miscibility curves come from [Lorenzen et al. (2009, 2011)](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.84.235109) and [Sch√∂ttler & Redmer (2018)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.115703). The H-He equations of state come from [Saumon et al. (1995; SCvH)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJS...99..713S/abstract), [Militzer & Hubbard (2013; MH13)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/774/2/148/meta), [Chabrier et al. (2019; CMS19)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aaf99f/meta), [Chabrier & Debras (2021; CD21)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abfc48/meta), and [Mazevet et al. (2022; MLS22)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2022/08/aa35764-19/aa35764-19.html). The CMS and MLS EOSes are supplemented by the work of [Howard et al. (2023a)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2023/04/aa44851-22.pdf) to account for the non-ideal entropy and volume interactions they calculated from MH13 and CD21. Moreover, we calculate H-He-Z mixutures using a water EOS from [Haldemann et al. (2020)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/11/aa38367-20/aa38367-20.html), iron, and post-perovskite EOSes from Jisheng Zhang (private communication).
