Common repository for H-He equations of state and miscibility curves. The H-He miscibility curves come from [Lorenzen et al. (2009, 2011)](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.84.235109) and [Sch√∂ttler & Redmer (2018)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.115703). The H-He equations of state come from [Saumon et al. (1995; SCvH)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJS...99..713S/abstract), [Militzer & Hubbard (2013; MH13)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/774/2/148/meta), [Chabrier et al. (2019; CMS19)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aaf99f/meta), [Chabrier & Debras (2021; CD21)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abfc48/meta), and [Mazevet et al. (2022; MLS22)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2022/08/aa35764-19/aa35764-19.html). The CMS and MLS EOSes are supplemented by the work of [Howard et al. (2023a)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2023/04/aa44851-22.pdf) to account for the non-ideal entropy and volume interactions they calculated from MH13 and CD21. Moreover, we calculate H-He-Z mixutures using a water EOS from [Haldemann et al. (2020)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/11/aa38367-20/aa38367-20.html), iron, and post-perovskite EOSes from Jisheng Zhang (private communication).

In this table, the headers are the independent thermodynamic variables and the quantities are the dependent variables and derivatives. See Tejada Arevalo et al. (2024) for a full description of these quantities.
